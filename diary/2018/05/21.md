Watching S02E01 of Legion. Amazing sound design.

Refactoring some of the _HackTile_ code. Pretty easy to get things up and running with SDL2, and I have a basic CA working (Conway, of course). Updating 50k cells at 50Hz minimum. I remember why C is so much fun!

Still unwell. Made lamb rogan josh for dinner... the kids can handle curry these days. First time making Indian for the whole family though. Eliza had Quiz Club after school. Jack played the trumpet during a music incursion.

Deep work is paying off. Scheduled each hour of the day. Doesn't take much effort to do, and I found I could focus and commit to a particular task more easily. May it continue!
