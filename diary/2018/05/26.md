Eliza's 12th birthday. Kids up early. Presents and breakfast, then took the kids to Garden City. Jack had a haircut, Eliza bought herself a Pokemon game. Back to prepare lunch; roast lamb with all the trimmings for 17 of us (both sides of the family). Played the C64 and the SNES with my brothers. Afternoon spent cleaning up and making lamb and barley soup for dinner. Played Letter Tycoon with the kids before they went to bed. Far too tired to work on HackTile; will watch an episode of The West Wing and crash.
