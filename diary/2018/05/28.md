Wintery day. Took Jack in early so he could do school banking, then off for grocery shopping before returning home to work. Productive; ended the current sprint, released to production and started the next. Always feels good.

Some work with the HackTile camera system, to the point where both camera and entities needed to be refactored out into their own files. Always tending the garden; need to minimise dependencies and make things neat and tidy. Need an entity manager to deal with the various entity pools (creating, busy, destroying, free), and need to support multiple cameras. This is mundane, humdrum but necessary, and will continue for a day or two.

Leftovers for dinner: lasagna and shepherd’s pie, with fresh salad and steamed corn on the cob. Jack a bit sleep deprived… being silly and squawky. Eliza in a bubble of happiness, still riding high after her birthday weekend.

Finished the day with Dzung watching Legion, then washing dishes while listening to The West Wing Weekly. Still coughing like crazy after this cold.
