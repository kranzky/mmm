Eliza’s Furby woke up in the middle of the night, talking loudly in the top of her wardrobe at 3am. Crazy! I woke up feeling nauseous. Not sure why.

A little work on HackTile, continuing the refactoring work.

Eliza gave a talk on shark culling at school. She made a great powerpoint and practiced her speech. Proud of her for busting through her nerves and speaking loudly and confidently in front of her class and teacher.

Pub lunch with Wil. Talk of Amigas and Twin Peaks, naturally. Dinner at Clancy’s in Freo with Lily and the entire family.
