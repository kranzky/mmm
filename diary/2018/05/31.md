Well, I've really fallen off the wagon right here. Didn't write this until the next day. Had a busy day of work, then looked after the kids while Dzung was out at company drinks. We picked up F&C from Tankk and watched YouTube videos. I had a beer. After putting the kids to bed and reading to Eliza, I was the one who was tanked, so I had an early night. Plan to make up for that "tomorrow".
