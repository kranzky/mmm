Well, well, well. Haven't been feeling well. Wrote a Rakefile to make writing diary entries more efficient. Full, productive day at work. Jack had his friend Eli over afyer school, but ended up throwing a tantrum. Punishment is a total screen ban over the WA Day long weekend. Made tortillas for dinner. Delicious with a G&T. Kids to bed and Dzung and I watched a few episodes of Endeavour, the Inpector Morse prequel with all the pretty girls. Well, I half-watched while finishing Mr. Mercedes. And, yet again, no Hacktile!
