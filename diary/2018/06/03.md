Beautiful morning. Eliza off to tennis training. Jack and I reading over a lazy breakfast, then searched for (and found) Dzung’s lost Kindle. Picked up Lilian and Eliza and headed to Dim Sum for family “brunch”. Beautiful sunny day eating outside at 8 On The Point. Went back to Van and Kiet’s and walked the kids over to the new adventure playground near the stadium, where they spent a happy hour building a cubby house.

Back home for a rest, then dropped the kids to Finlay’s for a sleepover. Dzung and I out to meet up with Annie and Elaine for a dinner at Garum, Guy Grossi’s new Perth restaurant. I thought the food was great, although not all of us agreed; there was a general mood of dissatisfaction with everything, which put somewhat of a damper on the evening. Ended with a brandy and a few more chapters, and, as you may have guessed, no HackTile.
