Sleep in. Dzung off to pick up kids from their sleepover, then I took Jack grocery shopping after a late breakfast of scrambled eggs and strong coffee. After lunch (Dzung made ramen) we went shopping for a new desk for Dzung's office (no purchase yet), then back home for a long session of Letter Tycoon (cold and rainy day, so indoor boardgames are perfect). Dinner of leftover tortillas and soup, followed by a session of Kirby Star Allies. Kids to bed, and Dzung and I finished the night by watching "I, Tonya". What a lazy WA Day!
