Busy day at work; got a lot done, and also managed to get the HackTile refactor finished to the point where everything is running once again. Nice to have abstracted out an entity manager, a camera manager and an input handler, improved object state and lifetime management, and cleaned up a lot of the code. Still much more to do, but progress being made!

Plan to finish the day with a bit more work on my day job, and then perhaps watch a movie or play some games tonight. Dzung is going to be cooking spaghetti and meatballs, but I must admit I'm still pretty full from the curry laksa we ate for lunch.
