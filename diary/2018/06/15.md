Work in the morning, then off to watch Jack's class assembly. He dressed as a ninja and spoke confidently in front of the school. Dropped Dzung at the office and worked through lunch, then into the city for a couple of interviews before meeting Matthew for a beer at Nowhereman. Then into Leederville for a six-pack of Guinness and pizza. Jack (my friend, not my son) joined us, and we chatted for hours. Showed them both HackTile. No work on it today but planning for what to do next. Home before 11pm, Dzung and the kids had roast lamb with my parents.
