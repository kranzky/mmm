Beautiful but chilly morning, Up early to do the laundry and have breakfast, then showered and to karate with the kids. Back home via the fish shop, lunch was seafood chowder with crusty baguette and some sushi on the side. Shopping after lunch for roast lamb tomorrow, and ingredients for stuffed tomatoes, which Dzung made for dinner. Delicious. Took the kids for a bike ride down to deep water point after hanging out the washing and listening to podcasts. Ate some fruit while watching the river. Saw Jumanji after dinner and demolished a box of Tee Vee Snacks. Feeling tired and run down, will have an early-ish night.

Refactored the input handler in HackTile. Feels much better now; controllers are managed properly and can be queried from anywhere. Nice. Will add mouse control for spawning entities over the next day or two, and will make the camera movement smoother and more precise.
