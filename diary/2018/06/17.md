We all had a bit of a sleep in. Late breakfast with the kids, then busy preparing roast lamb, potatoes, carrots, beans, brussel sprouts, salad, gravy and so on. Meat was a bit overcooked but delicious all the same. Ba raided our kafir lime tree for the restaurant as usual. Quickly packed up then over to Elaine’s for Mahjong with Josh, Annie and Mitzi. I worked on HackTile while Jack played Zelda and Dzung and Eliza played Mayjong with the others. Got mouse drawing working, and Eliza had a ball trying it out!

Amazing how much fun things are when you can interact. Had dinner at a nearby Thai place, before taking the kids home, leaving Dzung to play with the others. Jack and Eliza mucked around with HackTile a bit once we were home, then it was off to bed. And I’m exhausted, so an early night with “End of Watch” for me.
