Very busy day at work struggling with builds. Not fun. Day was grey and miserable. Jack’s lap-a-thon cancelled due to weather. Dzung made sweet and sour fish for dinner, to use up leftover coriander and spring onion. Delicious.

Switched to a new font for debugging, and made sure the font colour changes with the palette. And got sprites rendering from the hard-wired pixels into a texture buffer to update with the palette too. Need to get alpha working next, then on to a basic sprite editor so I don’t need to design these in hex digits.

Will end the night with a bit of Zelda, cheese and brandy. Time to celebrate.
