Morning meeting. Light day at work. Went shopping at lunch time to pick up groceries and beer, and to get the new Mario tennis game. A bit of HackTile in the afternoon; refactoring to add two game modes that can be toggled between, and starting to build out controls for the UI. This work will take a while.

Finlay over for a sleepover. I made tortillas. Everyone watching Hotel Transylvania 2 while I read End of Watch. Will have an early night.
