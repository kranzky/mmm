Up early. Did some work. Made breakfast and lunch. Took kids to school. Back home to bacon and eggs and some reading before working some more and going for a mid-morning ride around the river. Afternoon business call, then picked up the kids and off to swimming lessons. Then into the city for a pubby dinner at Butcher’s Arms and a look at the light installation in the city.

“C in a Nutshell” arrived today, and I did some refactoring of code based on the C11 standard as a result. Expect to refactor some more tomorrow, and continue on the editing UI. Feel like I’m entering another rut. Sigh.
