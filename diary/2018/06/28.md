Very busy at work. Eliza off sick. Managed to get some HackTile time; got the sprite editor to a state where I can draw pixels, but there was a funny bug, because I forgot to disable drawing to the world at the same time. I’ll need to set an active flag on the cameras too, similar to what I’ve done with the UI panels. So much more to do.

Meeting with Jack’s teacher. We will work hard getting him to improve his concentration and his ability to work unsupervised. Eliza’s report came through; she got eight As and has been promoted into the advanced maths track. Good girl!

Made shaking beef for dinner. Will relax before bed with The West Wing, wine and cheese. Oh, and I ordered the new TV. Should be delivered soon.
