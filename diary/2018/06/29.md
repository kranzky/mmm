Very busy at work. Beautiful clear day, but so very cold, so didn't go for a bike ride. Fixed the multiple drawing bug from yesterday, and improved the functionality of the sprite editor. The sprite data is now modified too, meaning palette changes work, and it's possible to select the drawing colour. Coming together, but still lots to do. Dinner over at mum and dad's house. All feeling a bit tired, so will call it a night. Might play a game before bed.
