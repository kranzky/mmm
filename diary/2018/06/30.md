Dzung took the kids to karate, so I spent the morning doing some work. Brunch was Korean BBQ at Van's place, and we overate, so had to move our dinner booking from 6:30pm to 8:00pm. Dropped the kids at Mum and Dad's, then worked on HackTile while Dzung took a nap.

![Sprite Editor](/diary/assets/sprite_editor.png)

Sprite editor taking shape. Created default sprites, and working towards having sprites selectable in the entity viewer. Also need to make entities selectable in the right-hand sidebar, and allow the sprite editor to be shown and hidden through menu items. Also need to support animation and serialization. Then this will be good enough to allow me to move on to the map editor and the rule editor. Exciting times.

Off to Kuzu for dinner, but time to kill before then, so will celebrate with a G&T and some gaming.
