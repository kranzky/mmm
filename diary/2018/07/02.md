First day of the school holidays. Cold and rainy. Did some activities with the kids; filmed Eliza doing her piano levels and helped Jack with his reading, but overall a busy day at work fixing the Android builds. Break at lunch to go shopping for holiday supplies, and to grab pies for lunch. Did some reading of the “Bullshit Jobs” book, which I agree with wholeheartedly. Dzung home to make soup and grilled pork with rice for dinner. Watched an episode of “Back in time for Dinner” with the kids while eating apricot yoghurt for dessert. It was the 1970s episode, and brought back a lot of childhood memories.

Kids to bed and then some HackTile work. Refactored the camera system to make zooming a lot more sane. Works well, although there is a limit to how far you can zoom out (to do with overflowing integers). Added keyboard controls to zoom in and out. Will need to refine this after returning from Nannup so I can move on to finishing the map editor. Will have lots to think about while bushwalking.
