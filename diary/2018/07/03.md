Worked in the morning but no time for HackTile. Dzung had to go in to the office to demo her project, so I organised the kids and got things packed up. Nice drive down to Nannup. No rain to speak of; we were lucky to miss the stormy weather. Great to be back amongst the big trees. Arrived and settled in, then over to visit Nagis, Ali and Nora (and Hora the dog, of course). Then back to our chalet to cook lamb cutlets and pasta for dinner. I'm doing dry July so missed the red wine. Played a bit of Resistance after eating, then ended the night in the hot tub. Glad to have a roaring log fire to keep us warm after getting out of the water!
