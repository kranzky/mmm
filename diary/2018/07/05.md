Last full day. Kids were freezing cold overnight. Made bacon burgers for breakfast and had an easy morning. Dzung walked the dog with the kids and went to say hello to the alpacas while I chopped wood. Drove into Nannup to get pies and pasties for lunch, then went for a walk along the Blackwood River. Back home to light the fire and hop into the spa. Roasted some vegetables for dinner and cooked the lasagna. Played a few rounds of Resistance then had an early night with electric blankets on for everybody. Almost finished reading “The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle”.
