Strong coffee and crumpet breakfast once the washing was on, happily flicking through new issues of The Guardian and New Scientist. Then off to karate with the kids, picking up seafood chowder and crusty baguette for lunch on the way home. Lazy afternoon, then dropped the kids to mum and dads. Picked up Annie for dinner at Tiny's. We ordered far too much. Then to the jazz festival to see the Perth Jazz Collective at His Majesty's. Back home to watch Endeavour with a cuppa.
