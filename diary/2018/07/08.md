Slept in, then a breakfast of scrambled eggs with leftover toasted baguatte outside in the winter sunshine. Picked up the kids; they didn't want to leave as they'd made new friends and were playing out the front. To Van's for spaghetti vongole. Returned home for a rest; I had a bad sinus headache that risked developing into a migraine, so lights out and listening to The West Wing Weekly with a strong coffee. A light dinner of leftover Cahn Chua, then watched an episode of Back in Time for Dinner. Must get back on to the HackTile bandwagon!
