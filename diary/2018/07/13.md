Took the kids to Riley’s for breakfast, then to Garbo where I bought “Captain Toad’s Treasure Tracker” and the Ultra HD version of “Bladerunner 2049”. Back home late morning and was busy at work for the rest of the day. Kids played games until Eva and Finlay were picked up after lunch.

Squeezed in some HackTile in the late afternoon. Optimised palette swaps, implemented serialisation for sprites, and removed all the code for creating default sprites. Worked great, but will have to revisit at some point when I support an architecture with a different endianess. So animation is now on the agenda. Looking forward to it!

Mum and Dad over to watch “Battle of the Sexes” on the new TV. Had some Thai delivered for dinner. Mum made dessert. Put the kids to bed, and ending the night watching an episode of “Endeavour” with Dzung and a cuppa. Noice.
