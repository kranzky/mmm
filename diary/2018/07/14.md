Regular Saturday. Lazy breakfast, clothes washing and karate. Rushed home via Garbo to pick up groceries for lunch, then kids off to piano while I cleaned my office and tried “MoonQuest”. Shopping in the afternoon with Dzung, buying things for dinner and tomorrow’s hotpot. Have decided to pause Dry July to be able to drink with our guests. But one day a month is pretty good, right?

Spaghetti and meatballs for dinner, then an episode of BiTfD before playing a few levels of Kirby with the kids. Got some more HackTile done, too.

Now that serialisation is working, I updated the entity editor to allow individual animation frames to be selected. Next will be to draw then animating, and to make it easy to preview animations by moving the controller. Drew some nicer sprites to aid in this work. And, after that, rules!
