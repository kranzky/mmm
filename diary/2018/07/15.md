Jack back to North Shore! We hope it’ll give him some discipline at school and that his grades will improve by the end of the year. Island Market for brunch; tried to limit what I ate. Then preparing steamboat once back home. Faith and Yoshiya loved playing the Vive, and I celebrated the halfway point of the increasingly inappropriately named “dry july” by sharing two bottles of red. Late night for the kids, and I couldn’t face cleaning up straight away, so watched “The Shining” first. Ended up still awake at 2:30am. No HackTile.
