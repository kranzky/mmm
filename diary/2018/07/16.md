Very hungover. Should have stuck to my guns and avoided the drink. Slow morning as a result. Needed to finish cleaning too. Mum took the kids in the middle of the day, so after a hot shower I worked from late morning to early evening, and continued after dinner. Now to bed at ten o'clock with no HackTile done, but at least I managed a full work day.
