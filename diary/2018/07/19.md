Super busy at work. Got heaps done, but exhausted by the end of it. Fish for dinner. Eliza not feeling well and upset after a visit to the allergy doctor and finding out she cannot select drama in year 8, as she’s already a music student. Must find something she can do outside of school. Jack doing well with his maths and reading. Dzung working hard. I can’t slog on with HackTile tonight; I played around a bit but coding rules still feels premature; need to steep a bit longer and show it to Danny and Wil tomorrow. Will chill out with the TV before bed instead.
