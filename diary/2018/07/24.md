Long, busy day. Heaps to do at work. Skipped lunch with Wil, and cancelled meeting with Will tomorrow. Eliza off early due to parent-teacher meetings; she had a ball visiting her old primary school with her friends. Walked home with both kids, just like old times (sob).

Dzung out for Chang’s birthday, after rushing home to meet with Eliza’s maths teacher. She’s a great mum. I took the kids to the shops to buy ingredients for Eliza to make tomorrow night’s dinner. Then picked up a huge feast of fish and chips, which we ate while watching the beginning of “Spiderman: Homecoming”.

Still working into the evening. Will watch an episode of Handmaid soon, then crash. No time to even think about HackTile.
