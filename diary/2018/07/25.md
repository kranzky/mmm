No HackTile. Extremely busy at work. Frantic. Dzung not feeling very well. Massive downpour at school pick-up time, trying to contact Eliza to tell her to stay undercover at the school, but that only ended up delaying me in traffic while she walked to the usual meeting spot in the park and got soaked. She cooked dinner, following a recipe from "You Plate It", using ingredients we bought ourselves. Finished the night watching a couple of episodes of "Handmaid's Tale".
