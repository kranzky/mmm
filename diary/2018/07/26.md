Very busy at work, but blindsided by a design coming out of nowhere, with it's own user stories, in no way following the documented spec. Worked furiously all day, from 7:30 to 17:00, with nary a break. Exhausted, cooked the salmon dish for the kids while Dzung took them to piano lessons. Philae arrived after dinner to mind the kids while Dzung and I went to "The White Album Concert". Third time we've been; other shows were in 2009 and 2014. Absolutely fantastic. Home at 23:00 to crash on the sofa and watch the last episode of "Sense 8". Too tired to finish it, I crawled to bed. Obviously no HackTile.
