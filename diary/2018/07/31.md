Busy day at work. Picked up Jack in the middle of the day to visit the immunologist. Needed to talk about Eliza, but they won't give you a follow-up appointment unless you bring a kid along. Found him digging in the playground with Eli and Josh. Appointment was good, happy to have a realistic action plan for anaphylaxis, and not a knee-jerk of giving the epi-pen the moment Eliza mentions a lump in her throat.

Picked up Jack after school and went shopping, then collected Eliza after orchestra. Made mapu tofu for dinner, and second attempt at Japanese-style grilled eggplant. Burned it this time. Hoping for third time lucky tomorrow.

Kids to bed, and I watched a couple of episodes of Handmaid's Tale before retiring. No HackTile.
