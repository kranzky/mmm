Busy day at work. Early morning meeting, and heads down all morning. Dzung and I to Kitchen Inn for lunch (after trying somewhere else that ended up being closed only on Wednesdays). They got my order wrong, so I only ate half of the plate. Working all afternoon, then cooked dinner with Eliza; steak, cous-cous, baby carrots. Turned out quite nicely.

Kids to bed, finished "Magician's Gambit". Then watched a couple of episodes of "The Handmaid's Tale" before sleep. Stormy outside, worried about the bins. Jack had earlier spotted a crow making a mess of our neighbour's bin, which we tidied up, but it's the wind that worries me.
