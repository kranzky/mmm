Casual day. Rainy morning. Did some shopping while kids at school. Good progress at work. Made lamb cutlets and pasta for dinner (mum and dad didn't get the kids due to poor weather). Glass of wine with Dzung to break the drought of dry July. Watched "The War on Waste" with Eliza after dinner. Quiet night, very tired.
