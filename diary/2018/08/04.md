Dzung has to work so I took the kids to karate, and stopped by Garbo on the way home to grab some pies for lunch. Crystal dropped Eli over and I took the kids into the Earth Sciences Museum at UWA where they had a great time looking at minerals and chatting to the lady there to help identify the rocks they've been digging up in the school playground.

Back home via mum and dad's for an afternoon tea of banana bread and crackers. Made Malaysian curry with potatoes, carrots and pork for dinner, along with grilled eggplant and roti. Curry too spicy for the kids, but delicious with a beer. Kids to bed and I cleaned up, then watched "The Death of Stalin" with Dzung.
