To the school for Jack’s Naidoc Week assembly. First time the junior choir were singing with their new shirts on. He was shy. Mid-morning the school called to say he was feeling sick. Dzung picked him up, and he perked up after a dose of Panadol. Leftover curry and roti for lunch, yum! Eliza’s graphics tablet arrived. Dzung took kids to piano but returned after Jack vomited all over himself in the car. Cleaned that up, then finished the workday. Sigh. Made sweet and sour fish for dinner. I did the laundry, crumbed and cooked the fish, cleaned, let Dzung finish preparing the dish, ate, cleaned up, put Eliza to bed. Finished the night washing dishes while listening to “The West Wing Weekly” before watching the Smash Brothers Nintendo Direct.
