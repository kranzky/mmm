Dzungâ€™s birthday! Up early to give cards and take Eliza and then Jack to school. Worked for a bit then lunch at Must. Chacuterie board with duck rilette, pork hock, pate and so on, roast chicken, angelhair crab pasta, wine and cheese. Mooched around Mt. Lawley, bought flowers, then bought a new set of headphones. Picked up Jack and Eliza, then teppanyaki at Nishi. Eliza loved it, Jack was initially scared, but came around by the end. Fantastic food and lots of fun. Feeling very tired, will call it an early night after cleaning up kitchen.
