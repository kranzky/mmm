Busy day at work. Took the phones in to get batteries replaced. Eliza very upset after school, having problems with her friends, cried in the bathroom for half of her science class, asked Dzung not to pick up her friends as she usually would. Terrible to see her so upset, and hard to know how to deal with it, apart from listening and cuddling.
