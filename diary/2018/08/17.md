Jack's "One Big Voice". Very exited; packed him a bag with ham and cheese sandwich, banana, pringles, oreos and cheese and crackers. Eliza did fine at school today. I did three reps of the workout and worked focused all day. Mum and dad over, then to Simple Italian before the show. Caught up with Sonny in the audience. Show was good but hard to see the kids. Jack tired and cranky afterwards... it was a long day for him!
