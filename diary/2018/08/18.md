Home with the chores while Dzung took the kids to karate and then piano. Leisurely breakfast, reading The Guardian and New Scientist, and podcasting while doing the laundry and cleaning the house. Dropped the kids to Kiet and Van’s in the afternoon, then to dinner at Andly’s Private Kitchen, near Agworld in West Leederville. It was much better than I expected; every course was delicious, and the lobster in a beer-based stew was a definite highlight!

Picked up the kids on the way back home; they were late to bed. Dzung crashed out, so I watched a couple of episodes of The West Wing before calling it a night.
