Regular day at work. Beatiful weather. Out to Malaysian with Dzung for lunch; nasi lemak, roti canai and iced coffee were all spot-on. Some reading in the sunshine in the afternoon; a physical copy of "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel arrived on the doorstep while we were at lunch. Kids out to piano, then Eliza helped me cook steak with a red wine and peppercorn sauce with truffled mashed potatoes and roasted green beans and cherry tomatoes. Absolutely delicious.

I really, really wanted to HackTile today, but there's just not enough time. Work is too busy, and I'm too tired by 9pm to do anything serious. So will end the night as always, by podcasting or watching The West Wing or Better Call Saul. Need to snap out of this malaise.
