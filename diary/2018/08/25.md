Sleep in. To Ma and Ba for cunging, then to Zenith for Jack's piano levels. Then shopping to get something for Lachlan tomorrow; a $50 iTunes gift card and two books; Terry Pratchett's "Sourcery" and "The Princess Bride". Out to the movies to see "Mirai", which was a very sentimental movie about generations of a family. Threecoins Trattoria for dinner, near Neera and Richard's place. Home for an early night; feeling worn out.
