Laundry while Dzung took Jack to North Shore. Read "Zero to One" in the sunshine for a late breakfast. Then to Van and Kiet's for barbeque for Lachy's eleventh birthday. Back home in the mid-afternoon, quick grovery shopping before playing Captain Toad with Eliza and then Jack. Tinned soup for a light dinner. Read to Eliza, then watched an episode of Better Call Saul with Dzung. To bed early, but unable to sleep.
