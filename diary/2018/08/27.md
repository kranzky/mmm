Busy day at work, finishing a sprint and shipping to production. To Jack’s school to help the class make pancakes for their Japanese lesson. Surprised with the other parent helpers, as usual, who leave as early as they can. I stayed and helped the teacher clean up the mess afterwards. Two of the girls in the class washed the dishes; really proud of them for doing such a great job without needing to be asked, at such a young age (8yo). Took Jack to karate for tip testing, then home to find Eliza waiting for us; she’d forgotten her house key. Eliza finished cooking parpadelle ragu for dinner, then kids to bed.
