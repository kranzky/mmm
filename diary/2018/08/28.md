Busy day. Picked Jack up and took him to Garbo for a haircut, but it was a 30 minute wait, so we just bought doughnuts instead. He was annoyed with me, even after I explained that it wasn’t my fault, and even after he agreed that he wouldn’t want to wait that long. The logic of an 8yo.

Picked up Eliza after string orchestra. We cooked lamb burgers for dinner. They were pretty good.

Working once the kids were asleep, but tired, and have an early start tomorrow. Haven’t been sleeping well, so drinking peppermint tea and will have an early night.
