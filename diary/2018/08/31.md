Wow. Havenâ€™t written anything for a week. Playing catch-up here. Enjoy reading back over my day-to-day, so need to get back into the habit, and resurrect HackTile too. Sigh.

Dzung out for dinner with Mary and Minh. Mum and Dad over, I cooked a BBQ and we ate hot dogs and sliders with salad and snacks.
