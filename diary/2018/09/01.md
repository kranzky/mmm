Took the kids to karate. As a treat for fatherâ€™s day tomorrow I had to do the lesson with them. So ninety minutes of working out. Not as cruisy as I would have hoped; had to do pushups with Jack sitting on my back!

Dropped off kids for a sleepover, then took an Uber out to Tsunami for a Japanese whiskey tasting with April and Aaron before a Teppanyaki dinner with the whole group of Uni friends. Then back to A&As for dessert and more whiskey.
