Quiet day at work; Labor Day in the USA. Took Jack to Piney Lakes to muck about after school, before collecting Eliza from quiz club. Leftover curry for dinner. Taking things easy. Angry at Eliza for leaving a group project to the last minute. But I hold her to a high standard; need to be aware she's doing this all for the first time.
