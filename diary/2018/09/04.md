Eliza off for rehearsal for tomorrowâ€™s concert. Took Jack swimming for a double makeup lesson. Dzung and Eliza stayed home to do homework and piano and prepare dinner. Home in the wet and the dark to have pasta with chorizo, pine nuts and ricotta. Delicious. Drank the leftover wine and tried to get the kids to bed early.
