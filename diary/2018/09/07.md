Missed a couple of days again :(

Busy day at work. Missed Jack singing at music assembly, but Crystal sent a video on WhatsApp. Dzung home after work to study, I picked up Eliza from Ice Skating and went to mum and dadâ€™s for dinner; they had collected Jack from school already. Delicious hearty meal of tender corned beef with mashed potatoes, carrots and cabbage. Fixed their internet; looks like the wifi router broke after a recent power surge.
