Work and chores in the morning while Dzung took kids to karate. Seafood chowder and crusty baguette for lunch. Lilian over to rehearse performance with Eliza; Zoe arrived while I was doing laundry. Cruisy afternoon, then Philae over to babysit while we took Van and Kiet to Andly’s private kitchen for dinner. Delicious, but sad they didn’t have the spicy pork mince snack, and the raw scallops weren’t too popular.
