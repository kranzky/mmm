Rained overnight; awoke to find the day bed awash. Set the tone for the day; motivation to work was low. The fact that everything was broken didn’t help. Banned Twitter and Reddit, as they are far to depressing and distracting. Visited mum and dad at noon to fix their internet (properly, this time). Began re-reading “Godel, Escher, Bach”. Toying with the idea of entering NaNoGenMo this year. Warmed up bad meatballs for dinner; Dzung won’t be buying those again. Watched The West Wing and read Ball Lightning.
