Dzung out to see the ballet. Dinner with the kids at mum and dad’s. Jack had a jumble sale at school today; we gave him money to spend, and he ended up spending it all on presents for his cousins. What an angel! Mum doted on me quite a bit at dinner, not sure what’s going on there. We had a good time chatting and snacking.
