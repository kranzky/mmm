Dzung at wine walk. Took kids to karate, then to Garbo, where Eliza bought a magazing of puzzles after seeing the ad for it at mum and dad's last night. Jack spent his $10 KMart gift voucher (on a small soccer ball). Bought pies for lunch, which we took home and ate, before playing outside for a while. Dzung came home slightly tipsy. We chatted outside in the sunshine, then played handball with the kids for a while. Lots of laughs! She then retired for a nap, emerging a few hours later to prepare dinner. We ate in front of the TV, watching an episode of Blue Planet II. Van and Kiet off on a holiday to Singapore and Vietnam today.
