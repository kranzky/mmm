Jack to North Shore in the morning, then we packed up picnic things, grabbed some food from the IGA and headed to King's Park. The spring festival is on at the moment, with live music. We picnicked and then let the kids play while we listened to the music. They made new friends, naturally. Next was a walk throught the park to see the wildflowers, ending up at the DNA tower. I threw Jack's new soccer ball from the top to Eliza and Jack waiting below. They also enjoyed getting wet at the fountain. Home for a rest, then Eliza and I made barbequeued lamb skewers for dinner. Early night; I was in bed by 10pm.
