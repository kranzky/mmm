Long sleep last night. Took kids to school, then a good day at work. Eliza went to Zophiaâ€™s house after school. Jack and I went shopping, then played together before walking her back homa again. Cooked spaghetti marinara for dinner. Set up some rechargeable candles for some serious hygge after dinner :)
