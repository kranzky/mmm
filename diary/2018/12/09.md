Spent the morning walking around Laguna Beach. Beautiful day. Got a late breakfast at Zinc Cafe (avocado toast and a flat white). Lots of sports cars roaring up the main street near the beach. Bought some supplies at Ralph's. Back for an afternoon rest, then got dressed and headed up to the house for the party. Edgar arrived with his wife, and Christa with her partner Danny, and Caroline with her sister Elizabeth. We drank old fashioneds and toured the property. Then in a car to the hotel for more drinks and dinner. Met Alex and his girlfriend Christine whom I had a great chat with; she's from a similar background to Dzung. After dinner more drinks; Christa was getting shots. Then back to the house to finish the night; I insisted on getting Caroline and Elizabeth glasses of water, which they didn't really want, and walked them to their car when it arrived. Didn't crawl into bed until 2:30am or so.
