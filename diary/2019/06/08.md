Well. Hasn't it been a long time? A summary:

- Eliza is a teenager. Gosh.
- Work is much the same.
- No progress on HackTile.
- No progress on Sesame.
- I actually completed NaNoGenMo: [Angela's Claustrum](https://github.com/kranzky/insoluble/blob/master/claustrum.md)

Maybe I'll hop back on the horse? Or whatever the expression is?
