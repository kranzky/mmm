Stayed up to watch the Ninty E3 direct. Nothing outstanding but fun nonetheless, and the kids get a rare treat of watching it over brekky before school. Walked the dog with D. in wintery weather; good opportunity to talk about life after finding out that a brother of a close friend passed away suddenly. It can happen at any time. Out to a laksa lunch in the cold weather. No progress on personal projects, which is unfortunate. Time is slipping away. Need to limit the work I do on my day job so I donâ€™t get distracted by it when I should have free time for my own things.
