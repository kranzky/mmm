Just finished reading "The Passionate Programmer" by Chad Fowler, which I discovered after writing a program to find great people on GitHub to try to fill an engineering position at my day job. That book talks about marketing yourself, and, combined with some other advice on that topic that I'd heard recently (although I can't remember where), I was motivated last night to rebuild my [vanity website](https://www.kranzky.com) to do a better job of that.

This lead to me rebuilding my [blog](https://medium.com/the-magic-pantry), which lead to me subscribing to Medium and finding an unpublished article entitled "Your Password is Terrible", which I published and received a clap for before my hands had left the keyboard.

I really should become more involved in the local scene here in Perth, so will look for a conference of a meetup that I can attend.
