Well. A lot has happened. We're in the middle of a global pandemic. I have [written about it](https://medium.com/the-magic-pantry/exponential-growth-is-going-viral-8ce77dac9ccc) and have [released a dashboard](https://corona.kranzky.com/) as well.

There's not much more to say. We're happy and healthy and taking care of our parents. And I'm learning to play the guitar.

We are very, very lucky. Lucky to be in Perth, a remote part of the world, with few cases, relatively speaking, than elsewhere. Lucky to live in a "food bowl" region, where we produce 300% of what we consume, unlike the UK, for example, which produces just 50% of what it consumes. Lucky to have kept our jobs. Lucky that we already worked from home, making isolating with the kids much easier. And lucky to have saved money for a rainy day.

I want to continue donating blood, and we need to figure out how we can be of help to other people.

Unfortunately, the family restaurant has closed its doors. For how long I cannot say.
