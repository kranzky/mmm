Western Australia has done a great job containing the spread of COVID-19, with just ten new cases over the past ten days. As a result some restrictions are being lifted, which raises the possibility of family brunch next weekend, and dinner with my parents. Fingers-crossed that numbers continue to look good; the risk is the delay between restrictions being lifted and numbers rising as a result (it could be up to two weeks for us to notice).

Watched “Music from the Home Front”, a great live concert on TV this Anzac Day. We stood on the driveway at 6am on Saturday the 25th with the kids for dawn service. At least half the street did the same. Kids sang “Song of Australia”.
