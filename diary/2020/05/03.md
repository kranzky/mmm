We’ve been in lockdown for over 50 days now, and yesterday was the first time in seven weeks that I’ve really felt bored. I had an overdue task to work on for my day job, which I was finding it difficult to get into, it was a gorgeous day but we had nowhere to go and nobody to visit, and all other forms of entertainment seemed trite. I guess I was suffering from ennui.

I feel better now; I’m making great progress on my overdue task, the weather is worsening, and I’m looking forward to playing some games later today :P
