First day of a new way of working.

Spent the weekend rearranging the home office, so I'll be in a different mental space. It feels good.

Kids are on holidays. Dropped Eliza in to an all-day drama course, then went shopping with Jack (bought some new coffee... important) and finished off with a bike ride.

Finishing the Big Sur upgrade. PostgreSQL had died. Played around with OBS for recording screencasts. Works better than iShowU. Plan to create a HelloWorld app that smashes RailRoad together with PixiJS and Howler. Need to separate RR out into a GEM first. So cracking on that.

Someone logged a MegaHAL bug noting that it doesn't work with Ruby3, which was released at XMAS, so fixing that too.
