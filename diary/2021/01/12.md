Worked on adding specs and coverage to both repos, and implemented Quasar as planned. Added all models, actions, views, services and workers. Has to switch to another service (ipstack) for doing geo-lookup of IP addresses when processing sessions. Working now on getting all specs passing, and then adding routes and swagger API documentation generation before testing the authentication flow. After that I'll get working on the template repo to expose all of these features in the UI. Fun!
