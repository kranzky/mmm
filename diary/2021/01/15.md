Finished the gem and updated the template repo, but didn't go down the path of working on UI as planned. Instead, I started a new repo from the template so I can play around with PixiJS and perhaps build the HackTile prototype more quickly. Got that set up and deploying to [hacktile.kranzky.com](https://hacktile.kranzky.com)
