We have life.

Apart from being sucked into US politics, I've spent the last week integrating PixiJS and Quasar/Vue to come up with a basic interface for viewing Conway's life, including drawing cells into the screen.

It was finicky getting the 320x192 screen to resize correctly and render crisply, and to handle fullscreen, resizing, desktop and mobile, visibility and so on, but it all Mostly Works (tm) now, so I can focus on functionality.

Next steps are:

- Add some more UI for editing the playfield
- Implement an EntityManager and EntityPool
- Refactor the Engine to use Rules that fire Actions to mutate State
- Allow these Rules to be edited in the UI
