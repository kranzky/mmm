Over the last week I did some tidying-up work on the Hacktile project, and back-ported some changes to the LetsPunk template. I then used that template to start a new project, Gumshoe, for the GGJ. Itâ€™s a procedurally-generated detective game, but it is also an excuse for me to learn more about Quasar and Vue, and practise UI coding, so it will benefit other projects too.

I will continue working on this in tandem with HackTile, switching between the two projects to maintain enthusiasm, and back-porting changes to the core framework that I make as I continue to learn.

In other news, we are in hard lockdown for five days. The kids should have started school today, but summer holidays have been extended for a week.
