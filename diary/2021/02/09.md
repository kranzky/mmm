Have spent the last week or so working on Gumshoe, a GGJ project that I started with Beetlefeet, using the lets-punk project template. Here’s a screenshot.

It’s destined to be a text-based roguelike detective game. But it’s also a crash course in using Quasar and Vue, and I am back-porting all of the improvements I make to the lets-punk template, and then porting them over to hacktile.

I have established a very comformatble hack-refactor-polish loop, whereby I quickly implement a new feature, then refactor the code to settle it down (as it often means code needs to be dry’ed up or improved elsewhere), and I then polish the UI, adding transitions and animations and making sure it’s responsive and works across all devices.

Have it working as a PWA on Android and iOS, with update notifications too. It’s feeling very slick. We’ve also exited lockdown and kids are back at school, so feeling even more productive.

Aim is to ship Gumshoe to get feeback from friends towards the end of this month, and then transition back to hacktile for most of my time.
