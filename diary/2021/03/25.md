Third Punk Collective meetup yesterday. Everyone seemed reluctant to meet and had various excuses, but in the end it all came together and we had the best meeting so far. We were all on the same page and spoke about creating and publishing one small game each in the latter half of the year, mostly to learn the ropes end-to-end and to attempt to build an audience. Looking forward to that!

The GumShoe refactoring is progressing nicely, and I can now see the light at the end of the tunnel. The game is still not quite there yet; the refactored version is janky and missing features when compared to the demo that I hacked together last month, but the code is much nicer to work with and to build upon, and it will make it easy for me to experiment with realtime client/server updates, and perhaps with multiplayer.

I'm really looking forward to getting all that done and dusted so I can get back to HackTile, which I think has great potential. Need more time in the day!
