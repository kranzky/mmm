Sidetracked by our Punk Collective commitment to build a game each in the next quarter. The other three punks have been super productive with their games, and so I spend the week working on something myself... Blattix!

This will be a retro-style shooter with multiple waves of enemies, going for high replayability rather than depth of content. I've drawn inspiration from[Encounter](https://youtu.be/4CHN-usjFfE?t=12), [Cosmic Causeway](https://youtu.be/i2SvzHY6JhY?t=1), [BallBlazer](https://youtu.be/ISXUs6kYS2Q?t=24) and[Vaxine](https://youtu.be/cT4fGokPVJ4?t=166).

It's been an excuse to learn some shader programming, and to brush up on my linear algebra. I'm not using a 3D game engine at all, it's just rendering sprites and doing a bit of tricky jiggery-pokery. Next I will move on to building a simple physics engine, which will allow collisions between objects, enabling some shoot-em-up gameplay.

Lots of fun!
