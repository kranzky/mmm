Well, we’re in lockdown yet again and BLaTTiX is getting close to beta release. As we go into July I expect the following will happen:

- I’ll work less on BLaTTiX, switching more to a mode of responding to bug reports and generally polishing it up for release (probably on September 1).
- Prototyping work will start on a couple of smaller-scope projects, “Noid” and “Deminer”.
- Gumshoe, HackTile and Punk! will be dusted off, and basically upgraded to use the latest versions of libraries &c.
- I may start exploring DownTown, Sesame and Onesie, my other 2021 projects.

All in all that’s a lot! Together with RnDB, which has already been completed, that makes 10 projects for the year. And we’re only just halfway through. Wow!
