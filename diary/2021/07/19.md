Well, here we are in mid-July; kids about to return to school after two weeks off. We spent some time down in Bunbury, which was nice.

I can see the finish line for Blattix; I have a small list of work to complete over the next ten days, and expect to entirely wrap it up by the end of the month. I also released a [starter kit](https://github.com/kranzky/raylib-flecs-starter-kit)for using Raylib+Flecs, and I plan to use this as the framework for my Deminer and Noid experiments.

Been somewhat distracted by the NSW lockdown, but deliberately weaning myself off the doomscrolling and the live press conferences. Must focus on productivity.

Will dust off Punk / Gumshoe / Hacktile later this week. Also plan to do some MegaHAL work so I can get a monkey off my back; a MegaHAL fan has asked that the new implementation be able to load brainfiles generated by the old 1990s version, and I reckon I can bust that out too.

Wish me luck!
