BLaTTiX is released! After two weeks of crunch, the game finally came together. Fifteen levels spread across five planets, with eight enemy types. Not too shabby! Reckon I spent around 350 hours on this, spread across 129 calendar days. And now I'm learning to market something I've made. Sales are trickling in, and I'm planning to write and post about the project in the hope of capturing an audience. But, soon, it will be on to something else.
