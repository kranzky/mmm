Last post before I turn `0x32` on Saturday.

Had a great 2021, releasing 5 projects. Finished and launched “Gravitas” on Christmas Eve.

This year I’m having a bit of a break in January, spending time with the kids and so forth, but in the background Beetlefeet and I have been working on coming up with 100 startup ideas. I did the “Aspiring Founders” startup school as part of this effort.

I also wrote a Twitter bot to solve the daily Wordle.

I plan to divide by week between 6 activities this year:

- GroupFire
- The Punk Collective
- Untitled Startup
- Fun Hacks
- Exercise
- Reading

We’ll see how it goes!
