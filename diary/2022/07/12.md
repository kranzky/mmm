Long time! So what's happened in the last six months?

- I'm slowly looking for work. Not good medicine for the ego.
- Got MegaHAL back online again at [megahal.kranzky.com](https://megahal.kranzky.com)
- Working on Lazybones (formerly Hacktile) and it's going well
- Released Sesame with Jack

I also released Gravitas at the end of last year. So feeling pretty productive, even though I'm not earning a lot of $ at the moment.

Keeping fit and doing heaps of reading; 24 books so far this year. Have just joined a few different libraries as it's getting to be an expensive hobby.

New bike has been ordered and will be delivered in September. Looking forward to it. Managed to dodge COVID; both the kids had it recently but they isolated in their bedrooms and we kept the windows open even though it was freezing cold.

I'll try to write more regularly again as I enjoy reading mundane daily entries from a few years ago. It's the usual thing; I feel I've got nothing to write, and I always hate what I've written until enough time passes. Then it seems OK.

Plan is to release Lazybones soon, build some landing pages to try to get a new startup idea off the ground, start earning money again in a new job, and generally avoid COVID and have fun with the family. A simple life.
