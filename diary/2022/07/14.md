Spent yesterday at Treetop Adventures in Yanchep, with family visiting from Hong Kong and one of their family friends. Lots of fun; the black course was challenging and I feel a bit worse for wear today. Battered and bruised with aching muscles. I rely too much on my arms to counteract my poor sense of balance.

Caught up with Traveller and a few friends for dinner at Long Chim in the evening. It was great to see her and hear about life in London.

The "Mazes for Programmers" book arrived today, so I'm mooching through that while looking out at a rain-drenched garden. Wife and kids are out at brunch with their cousins this morning; last day in Perth for them today before returning to a one-week hotel quarantine. It'll be Bun Loc for dinner; a perfect meal for a wintry day.
