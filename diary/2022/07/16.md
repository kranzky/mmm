Returned home from dinner on Thursday night to somehow find Bailey in the garage, even though I swore I had put him outside before he left. Phone call in bed the following morning; Bailey was out on the street. So first mystery solved only to be replaced by another. Had he figured out how to squeeze through the gate? We tried in vain to get him to do just that, but even his favourite dried liver treats (crack for dogs according to the veterinarian) wouldn’t tempt him to attempt the feat. I suspect that Noah, a mischevious boy from up the street, came over on Thursday evening and again on Friday morning to ask Jack to play basketball, and had opened the gate and let Bailey out. Might get a camera.

Took a train to West Leederville with Jack to meet Dzung at Besk. Great beer, and the steak tartare, cheeseburger, gnochi and bone marrow were all top class. Returned via the city where I picked up my library card and borrowed a stack of books. Olive Ketteridge and Recursion for me. Bought some Telegram coffee beans too, and refreshed ourselves with bubble tea before training it home again (before which Jack walked into a pole while not looking where he was going). Did some reading in the afternoon after Jack signed up for GoodReads so he can share his progress with me. Hopefully that’ll spark the bug in him; he needs to improve his English grades at school.
