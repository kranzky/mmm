Family brunch on Sunday at Imperial Court. Was prompted afterwards to update my review, likening Phylis to the Soup Nazi of Seinfeld fame. Good dim sum if you bring a sense of humour and don't get offended by her brusqueness.

Spent Monday with Jack. We dropped the car off for a service, then caught the bus to Garbo for haircuts and to sign up for the library at the Melville Civic Centre, then ate an early lunch at Miss Maud's before doing a spot of shopping. Made shaking beef for dinner because the watercress looked so good.

Kids back to school on Tuesday. Had a great bike ride around Bibra Lake in the morning, and applied for a few roles. Lots of irons in the fire. I've even signed up for some management courses as that's one skill I feel I lack. We'll see how it goes. Traveller over for lamb and red sauce pasta; she regalled us with tales of a new Marvel TV series, but it's all hush-hush. Enjoyed a few glasses of red. Nice evening.
