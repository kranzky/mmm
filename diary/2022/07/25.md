Bought and installed a Nest outdoor camera to monitor Bailey. Out at Kanpai Yakiniku for dinner with Traveller on Friday night and got a notification; watched the live feed to see him trying to squeeze through the gate! Much laughter as we used the microphone to tell him to stop. Home after Korean desserts to bring him inside. Quick trip to Bunnings on Monday morning to buy some materials to block the gaps in the gate and prevent this from happening again.

Apart from that, a fairly quiet weekend. Did a long walk around North Lake with Bailey, Jack commenting that it felt like being in Breath of the Wild. And had the family over for Sunday brunch. Watched Spiderman No Way Home. And made some progress with books and online management courses.
