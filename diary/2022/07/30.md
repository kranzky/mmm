Good night at Ezra Pound with the boys, snacking on antipasto and pasta from the neighbouring spaghetti store, who are happy to bring the food into the bar. Then to Laineyâ€™s house on Thursday for takeaway with Traveller and Hooi. Jack practised guitar after eating, then he and Eliza jammed for a while, making use of a keyboard loaned to Lainey by a friend. Lilian had her year 12 ball on Friday night and looks so grown up!
