Just signed on for a new role! Had two competing offers, both very similar, with a good interview and technical evaluation at both. Applied for around 15 roles altogether, over a 3 month period of slowly looking. Not all were good experiences. Some recruiters suck, some are awesome, most are between the two. Sometimes my application was rejected without comment, sometimes I was rejected without comment after a non-technical interview for “cultural fit”. In almost all cases the take-home programming projects were a lot of fun and I gladly did them; about five in total. I only had one interview that asked “gotcha” trivia questions (like fizzbuzz), which caused me to immediately disconnect from the process. Had to sadly say no to three or four places that were looking promising and where I really liked the people I met. Man, job hunting sucks. It’s both bad for the ego and hard when forced to choose between multiple offers. Glad it’s over!
