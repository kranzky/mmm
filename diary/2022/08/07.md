Great catching up with the old gang for Ade's 50th this morning at a Malaysian buffet in East Perth. Lots of good memories from back in the day. And I'm still riding, playing squash and sinking pints of Guinness after all these years. Need to do more to keep in touch; should organise a monthly meetup or something like that. Kids had a piano concert afterwards; they both played very well but Eliza was super nervous beforehand and very hard on herself. She should be proud.
