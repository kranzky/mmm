D. and I went on a lovely hike in Roley Pool Reserve, followed by lunch at Seven Sins. Nice food but lots of it! Always great whiling away a crisp and clear morning in the hills. Must return during spring to see the flowers; along one section of the walk the ground was covered with kangaroo paws not yet in bloom.

Had mum and dad over for roast lamb to celebrate D’s birthday, then the kids slept over at their place the following night so we could go to “Flight Club” with friends, followed by a nice dinner and an evening of Catan, Five Crowns and generous lashings of single malt.

Caught up with Ade and Wil for a Monday roast at Durty’s. Good to have a chance to chat with Ade after only seeing him briefly at his 50th.

Really enjoying Oliver Burkman’s “Four Thousand Weeks”. Lots of good advice. Will keep mindful of this once I start my new job next week!
