What a whirlwind of a week! The kids charged back to school, and Eliza tackled her tests head-on, even though it cost her some precious Zs. And guess who's now a member of the big 5-0 club? My good friend Wil! We caught up on Monday after a long, school-holiday-induced separation. Also, we've started watching Sweet Tooth with the kids, and they can't get enough of it!

But life is full of surprises: Dana, my incredible wife, suddenly needed gall bladder surgery. Poor thing had to skip the Bali trip with her friends. On the bright side, the weather turned cold and rainy, making our home a perfect nest of comfort. Last night, we savoured an amazing steak dinner, straight out of the anime "Campfire Cooking in Another World Using My Unique Skill". Work's going great too â€“ I'm making fantastic progress, and there's a big project milestone waiting for me next week. Bring it on!
