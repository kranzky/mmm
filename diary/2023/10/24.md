How annoying. I've been emailing back-and-forth with Magdalena Tymczyszyn of PicRights about a copyrighted image that appears on my FAQOverflow hobby website. I wouldn't have minded if they'd just asked me to take down the page, but they had the audacity to ask me to pay $970 for the past unauthorised use of the image.

Now, I don't host the image, Stack Overflow does. And I only display the image because my hobbyist site, last updated in early 2014, accesses data from the Stack Overflow API. Usage of that data is licensed as cc-wiki by Stack Overflow, and I have dealt with them multiple times in the past. Each time they confirmed that FAQOverflow abides by their license.

I tried explaining that to Magdalena, but she was unhelpful. So I have removed the image from the FAQOverflow page and will contact a lawyer. How annoyance.

On the bright side, I managed to get six of my old games uploaded and playable on [kranzky.itch.io](https://kranzky.itch.io) - it's nice to make sure these things are archived for posterity. Makes me want to create more stuff. I have some ideas. Might do NaNoWriMo this year to scratch that itch.

And over five months since I've last posted! Jack is 14, Eliza is in her last few weeks of high school, we've travelled and are basically living happy lives, apart from gold-digging copyright claims that is.
