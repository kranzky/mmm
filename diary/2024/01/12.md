Well, I still haven’t been sued by PicRights. They did reduce their requests for damages by 1/3 but it’s ridiculous that they expect me to pay anything. So it’s just a case of wait-and-see for me. What a horrible way for a business to make money; going for the small-fry who are easier pushovers.

Anyway, new year and things are going well. Eliza is off on a month-long holiday around the world before she starts Uni. We’ll miss her, but I’m sure it will be a memorable experience for her.

I’ve also started a podcast with Talbs, called[The Movies of 1999](https://1999.kranzky.com). It’s a side-project of my goal in 2024 of hosting a movie night every Sunday to watch a movie from 1999. It’s off to a good start, and I hope we can keep the motivation and release all 52 episodes. Only time will tell!

I will leave the final word to [MegaHAL](https://megahal.kranzky.com)…
