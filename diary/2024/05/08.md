Well, it's been a while! Back in March Timothy Webb of Clayton Nutz, a law firm, sent me an email (actually, Prashant Bhardwaj sent it, but it was signed by Tim) regarding the PicRights / Reuters copywrite phishing attempt on my old [FaqOverflow](https://faqoverflow.kranzky.com/) hobbyist website.

They threatened taking the case to court, asking for a settlement of $2,425.00, while denying that this is a classic case of copyright trolling. To me the whole thing has a debt collector vibe to it. Some business models are just... well, let's just say that I wish more people followed their creative urges rather than following the dollar.

What's even more interesting is that [www.claytonutz.com](https://www.claytonutz.com/) contains lots of licensed images (a simple reverse-image search is enough to prove that), which of course they will have paid for, but their [copyright notice](https://www.claytonutz.com/site-information/copyright-notice) clearly states that all material on their website, including images, can be reproduced for personal and non-commercial purposes.

I would be very surprised if their licenses from Adobe Stock and Getty Images allow them to transfer the rights like that, but who am I to argue? I did email their webmaster 40 days ago about this, but they've yet to reply. Things move slowly in some industries I suppose.

Anywy, these might serve as a honeypot for other copyright trolls, and I'll then be able to use my "deez nuts" defense, forwarding any copyright claims I get on to good ol' Timbo to handle.
