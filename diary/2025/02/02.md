Well, I've dropped the ball already.

It was my birthday during the week I missed. It was nice. Had family over, and went to a nice lunch with D. and the kids. Saw Bogan Shakespeare at Fringe, and had a nice dinner with the Hos at Monsterella. And Australia Day to boot!

Second week my BIL and his family visited from HK. We holidayed down in Mandurah and went crabbing each evening, bagging a baker's dozen. I read most of "The Master and Margarita".

Still riding regularly, even though it's been a heatwave. And getting ready for Jack's return to school, which will see us shifting back to a regular routine, which will hopefully mean that I will spend more time on hobby projects.
