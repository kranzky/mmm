Well, I've dropped the ball already.

It was my birthday during the week I missed. It was nice. Had family over, and went to a nice lunch with D. and the kids. Saw Bogan Shakespeare at Fringe, and had a nice dinner with the Hos at Monsterella. And Australia Day to boot!

Second week my BIL and his family visited from HK. We holidayed down in Mandurah and went crabbing each evening, bagging a baker's dozen. I read most of "The Master and Margarita".

Still riding regularly, even though it's been a heatwave. And getting ready for Jack's return to school, which will see us shifting back to a regular routine, which will hopefully mean that I will spend more time on hobby projects.

Last week of the before times (the new president is to be sworn in tomorrow). Weird tik-tok flip-flop. I was feeling a bit off all week, but still managed 3 bike rides to hit 80km, and I made a start on the "Rhyme or Reason" project, but was more prone to distraction than I would have liked. It's challenging because it's still the holiday period so I'm not quite back into a normal routine yet.

New outdoor setting delivered from Bay Furniture in Dunsborough, and very happy with the results. Got the backyard set up. And new washer and dryer after our ones carked it; they were making horrible grinding noises and something had leaked into the washing machine that stained the clothes. Easy to pop into Winning Appliances to view and order a new set, they were on sale so saved $1400 and were delivered promptly and set up much better than the previous set were.

Out to see Adam Hall on Saturday night. Started at Edward and Ida's for great cocktails and food, then sauntered down to the State Theatre for the show in the outdoor courtyard area, where we met up with some friends, and then ended the night at Shadow Wine Bar. I had probably one drink too many so didn't feel the best the next morning.

Ended the weekend with the family over to try out the new outdoor setting. It was a pretty warm night so I didn't think we'd sit outside but everyone seemed happy to do so. Dzung made a nice chacuterie board and I gradually brought out other food (barbequeued scallops, sausages, potatoes dauphinoise, beef and chicken kebabs, salads) as everyone chatted. Ended with a lemon and raspberry birthday cake in the cool indoors. Simple and cruisy, just the way I like it.

Spent the week down in Dunsborough with my parents; we rented an AirBNB right opposite the beach at Dunn Bay. Really relaxing and cruisy; my morning routine was to wake up at 7:30, go for a long bike ride (either towards Busselton, when I'd turn back after 16km or so, or up to the top of the MTB Park, where I'd follow the various green runs back down again). After that I'd change into my bathers and head to the beach for a dip in the water to cool off before returning to the house to make a strong coffee and read in the sunshine while watching the blue fairy wrens hop around the garden.

Finished a couple of books ("Snapshot" and "Tales from the Cafe") while down there, and made a start on "Bliss", which serendipity found for me when I entered the small bookstore in town; it was made into a movie in 1985 so I know I'll be watching it some time this year.

The place was pet friendly, so Bailey got to go on his first family holiday, which he loved. Much of the beach was dog friendly, and he even paddled out a little bit. Jack and I had fun skimming stones.

Nice meal at "Blue Manna" in town, and lunch at "Amelia Park". Played games and listened to music. Cooked a couple of nice steak dinners, making a delicious Diane sauce. Was surprised at the extend of mum's memory loss; she had a few senior moments such as losing her toothbrush and using mine instead.

Bruce and Mel joined us for our final day, as my folks needed to leave early. Happy hour at a bar in town was nice, as was brunch the following morning before the drive back after making sure the Ioniq 5s were fully charged.

Dzung and I bought some new outdoor furniture while down there. Free shipping and we'll have it on Wednesday. We're also considering a new lounge, just need to confirm the measurements of the rug that it will sit on.

Straight to Rob's birthday pizza party after arriving back home on Saturday. Met lots of Agworld folk that only knew me from my git commits (I left the company almost ten years ago, resigning on Monday the 16th of February 2015, and have been working remotely ever since).

Had a long chat with Andrew, whom I hadn't seen since leaving Agworld. Jack, Krystal, Andrew and I entered Nanowrimo in 2015, and I wrote "Insoluble" then. You can[read it on Medium](https://medium.com/insoluble-consciousness-explained)if you're so inclined,[get it on Kindle](https://www.amazon.com.au/Insoluble-Consciousness-Explained-Accurate-Historical-ebook/dp/B0C4L3Y154)or even order the paperback! Anyway, I digress. We had a long chat, Andrew talking about his older son who is now training as a fighter pilot in Germany, and his younger son who is going into year 11. I spoke about my interests during which it dawned on me that I really like exploring how technology can help with three things that are often not given the attention they deserve: discovery (i.e. how to find unknown unknowns), creativity (i.e. how to have an idea and build something new) and community (i.e. how to foster trusted relationships amongst a group of strangers). More on those things later this year perhaps, for now I don't want to set the weeknotes bar too high so I'll end things there.

My first weeknotes!

Have just finished recording and publishing the first episode of "The Movies of 1985". It was NYE this week so work was interrupted; still during the shutdown period so I knocked off some lower-priority tasks that wouldn't get done otherwise. Usual New Year's with Hoff, Elaine and family. We did a French theme; Dzung made onion soup, I did potatoes daphenoise, Eliza made hors douvres and Hoff made a beef bourgonoin with wagyu chuck, and please forgive my spelling. We slept over after staying up past 1:30am drinking whisky. Hoff shared a 1998 Grange at dinner which was amazing. We brought a white wine to go with the soup and a bottle of bolly (i.e Bollinger). We all went to Viet Hoa for lunch the next day where I had the worst indigestion ever. An inauspicious start to the year but hopefully that set the low water mark and it'll be all uphill from there. Fireworks on the Shelley foreshore with the family that night, then back to work for a few days. Drinks, a swim and games (hues and clues) at Elaine's on Friday and recorded the last "The Movies of 1999" podcast with Craig on Saturday morning. Had a great catch-up with the Uni crowd at Neera and Richard's on Saturday night where more games were played (codenames). Rode over 80km in three separate bike rides this week; my goal is a modest 2500km this year, along with reading 36 books, as well as less drinking and more exercise in general. Usual family brunch on Sunday. Looking forward to a week's break down in Dunsborough starting tomorrow!

I will really try to write in paragraphs, or use bullet points next time. And I want this to be about personal projects, so I'll make a start on that once holiday mode is over.

This is a test post. It has been quite a while since I last posted here, but in 2025 I plan to post once a week, so I want to make sure everything is tickety-boo. I've also (finally) switched over to a paginated view.

Well, it's been a while! Back in March Timothy Webb of Clayton Nutz, a law firm, sent me an email (actually, Prashant Bhardwaj sent it, but it was signed by Tim) regarding the PicRights / Reuters copywrite phishing attempt on my old[FaqOverflow](https://faqoverflow.kranzky.com/)hobbyist website.

They threatened taking the case to court, asking for a settlement of $2,425.00, while denying that this is a classic case of copyright trolling. To me the whole thing has a debt collector vibe to it. Some business models are just... well, let's just say that I wish more people followed their creative urges rather than following the dollar.

What's even more interesting is that[www.claytonutz.com](https://www.claytonutz.com/) contains lots of licensed images (a simple reverse-image search is enough to prove that), which of course they will have paid for, but their[copyright notice](https://www.claytonutz.com/site-information/copyright-notice)clearly states that all material on their website, including images, can be reproduced for personal and non-commercial purposes.

I would be very surprised if their licenses from Adobe Stock and Getty Images allow them to transfer the rights like that, but who am I to argue? I did email their webmaster 40 days ago about this, but they've yet to reply. Things move slowly in some industries I suppose.

Anywy, these might serve as a honeypot for other copyright trolls, and I'll then be able to use my "deez nuts" defense, forwarding any copyright claims I get on to good ol' Timbo to handle.

Well, I still haven't been sued by PicRights. They did reduce their requests for damages by 1/3 but it's ridiculous that they expect me to pay anything. So it's just a case of wait-and-see for me. What a horrible way for a business to make money; going for the small-fry who are easier pushovers.

Anyway, new year and things are going well. Eliza is off on a month-long holiday around the world before she starts Uni. We'll miss her, but I'm sure it will be a memorable experience for her.

I've also started a podcast with Talbs, called[The Movies of 1999](https://1999.kranzky.com). It's a side-project of my goal in 2024 of hosting a movie night every Sunday to watch a movie from 1999. It's off to a good start, and I hope we can keep the motivation and release all 52 episodes. Only time will tell!

I will leave the final word to [MegaHAL](https://megahal.kranzky.com)...
