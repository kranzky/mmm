Dzung at wine walk. Took kids to karate, then to Garbo, where Eliza bought a magazing of puzzles after seeing the ad for it at mum and dad's last night. Jack spent his $10 KMart gift voucher (on a small soccer ball). Bought pies for lunch, which we took home and ate, before playing outside for a while. Dzung came home slightly tipsy. We chatted outside in the sunshine, then played handball with the kids for a while. Lots of laughs! She then retired for a nap, emerging a few hours later to prepare dinner. We ate in front of the TV, watching an episode of Blue Planet II. Van and Kiet off on a holiday to Singapore and Vietnam today.

Dzung out to see the ballet. Dinner with the kids at mum and dad's. Jack had a jumble sale at school today; we gave him money to spend, and he ended up spending it all on presents for his cousins. What an angel! Mum doted on me quite a bit at dinner, not sure what's going on there. We had a good time chatting and snacking.

Productive day at work. Chicken macaroni soup for lunch. Delicious!

Great day at work; finished a sprint and shipped to production. Process going well, lots to do. Jack's school sports carnival (Finlay too) so, although Dzung and I very busy at work, we dashed in to the school three times to watch events. He went well, and ended up winning a gift voucher for the best decorated cake box.

Dzung took Jack to swimming after school. Eliza had a viola audition for next term, but she wants to stay in string orchestra anyway. Mix up picking up Eliza and Zophia; I forgot I'd told Eliza I would pick her up from the school. Dzung waited for her in the park. Neither was happy with me.

Dzung took Jack swimming. I made chicken macaroni soup, including a big new batch of garlic oil. Absolutely delicious. Ended the night curating podcasts and making up stories for Jack.

Great day at work. Everything came together. Deployment issues from yesterday were fixed by our provider, sprint planning meeting went well, fixed a few issues and released to production.

Had a fright driving the kids home from school; saw a hideous creature in a car stopped at the traffic lights. Looked like something from The Dark Crystal, with its misshapen head bobbing around independently of its body, and no nose, mouth or ears to be seen; just a blank face. Turned out it was a bald guy with his sunglasses on his head looking down at his phone in his lap.

Dzung out, so made tuna mornay for me and the kids. Quite delicious. Jack and Eliza busy decorating the cake box for tomorrow's sports carnival, and baking cookie-and-cream cupcakes from a packet mix. Did it all themselves, even the cleaning up.

Rained overnight; awoke to find the day bed awash. Set the tone for the day; motivation to work was low. The fact that everything was broken didn't help. Banned Twitter and Reddit, as they are far to depressing and distracting. Visited mum and dad at noon to fix their internet (properly, this time). Began re-reading "Godel, Escher, Bach". Toying with the idea of entering NaNoGenMo this year. Warmed up bad meatballs for dinner; Dzung won't be buying those again. Watched The West Wing and read Ball Lightning.

Beatutiful spring day. Lazy morning while Dzung took the kids to tennis and North Shore. To Van and Kiet's for brunch; cold meat and spaghetti vongole. Set up the daybed once home and read books with Jack while Dzung napped and Eliza played with her new dot diary and textas. Leftovers for dinner, and watched the first episode of Blue Planet 2 with the kids while Dzung studied. Finished the night listening to podcasts.
