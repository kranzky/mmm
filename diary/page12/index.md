Took the kids to karate. As a treat for father's day tomorrow I had to do the lesson with them. So ninety minutes of working out. Not as cruisy as I would have hoped; had to do pushups with Jack sitting on my back!

Dropped off kids for a sleepover, then took an Uber out to Tsunami for a Japanese whiskey tasting with April and Aaron before a Teppanyaki dinner with the whole group of Uni friends. Then back to A&As for dessert and more whiskey.

Wow. Haven't written anything for a week. Playing catch-up here. Enjoy reading back over my day-to-day, so need to get back into the habit, and resurrect HackTile too. Sigh.

Dzung out for dinner with Mary and Minh. Mum and Dad over, I cooked a BBQ and we ate hot dogs and sliders with salad and snacks.

Busy day debugging Android issues. Out for a nice Thai lunch with Dzung, and grabbed new bio bags from the Melville civic centre. Leftover curry, roti, rice and soup for dinner. Listening to music with the kids afterwards, lots of singing and dancing. Jack loves Josh Pyke and Superorganism. Fun!

Busy day. Rainy squall when I picked up Jack and Eliza. Hot milo and raisin toast and a warm house were welcome afterwards. Ventured into the city to meet Jack, Rob and Tris for drinks and dinner. Beer, whisky, sake and ramen, and lots of chatting. Great night!

Busy day. Picked Jack up and took him to Garbo for a haircut, but it was a 30 minute wait, so we just bought doughnuts instead. He was annoyed with me, even after I explained that it wasn't my fault, and even after he agreed that he wouldn't want to wait that long. The logic of an 8yo.

Picked up Eliza after string orchestra. We cooked lamb burgers for dinner. They were pretty good.

Working once the kids were asleep, but tired, and have an early start tomorrow. Haven't been sleeping well, so drinking peppermint tea and will have an early night.

Busy day at work, finishing a sprint and shipping to production. To Jack's school to help the class make pancakes for their Japanese lesson. Surprised with the other parent helpers, as usual, who leave as early as they can. I stayed and helped the teacher clean up the mess afterwards. Two of the girls in the class washed the dishes; really proud of them for doing such a great job without needing to be asked, at such a young age (8yo). Took Jack to karate for tip testing, then home to find Eliza waiting for us; she'd forgotten her house key. Eliza finished cooking parpadelle ragu for dinner, then kids to bed.

Laundry while Dzung took Jack to North Shore. Read "Zero to One" in the sunshine for a late breakfast. Then to Van and Kiet's for barbeque for Lachy's eleventh birthday. Back home in the mid-afternoon, quick grovery shopping before playing Captain Toad with Eliza and then Jack. Tinned soup for a light dinner. Read to Eliza, then watched an episode of Better Call Saul with Dzung. To bed early, but unable to sleep.
