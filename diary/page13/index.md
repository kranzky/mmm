Sleep in. To Ma and Ba for cunging, then to Zenith for Jack's piano levels. Then shopping to get something for Lachlan tomorrow; a $50 iTunes gift card and two books; Terry Pratchett's "Sourcery" and "The Princess Bride". Out to the movies to see "Mirai", which was a very sentimental movie about generations of a family. Threecoins Trattoria for dinner, near Neera and Richard's place. Home for an early night; feeling worn out.

Slow day at work; mostly devops. Jack home early from school with a cold; he went in to dress up as a ninja for book week. Mum and Dad over for dinner. Nice chatting and snacking by the window with the afternoon sun warming us. But I'm coming down with Jack's cold I think.

Regular day at work. Beatiful weather. Out to Malaysian with Dzung for lunch; nasi lemak, roti canai and iced coffee were all spot-on. Some reading in the sunshine in the afternoon; a physical copy of "Zero to One" by Peter Thiel arrived on the doorstep while we were at lunch. Kids out to piano, then Eliza helped me cook steak with a red wine and peppercorn sauce with truffled mashed potatoes and roasted green beans and cherry tomatoes. Absolutely delicious.

I really, really wanted to HackTile today, but there's just not enough time. Work is too busy, and I'm too tired by 9pm to do anything serious. So will end the night as always, by podcasting or watching The West Wing or Better Call Saul. Need to snap out of this malaise.

Busy day at work. Exercised. Took kids swimming, then met up with Dzung at Restaurant Jun for yakitori and sake. Had a quiet evening.

Busy day at work. Dzung out to the movies. Made tortillas with the kids for dinner. Regular Tuesday.

It's now been a month since I last did anything with HackTile. Well, 28 days at least. That's bad; I've fallen off the wagon completely. Time to get back on.

Up early. Beautiful day; spring has sprung early. Walked Jack to school, then worked for a while before going to donate platelets. Worked through the afternoon, and picked up the kids from school. Eliza had elected to skip her usual Monday Quiz Club to avoid being near her friends, but later messaged me to say she'd go after all, and then called on Zophia's phone to say it had been cancelled. I was at the IGA with Jack; we ended up going to the high school early to get the girls. Nice to see Eliza has made up with them.

We cooked dinner together. Jack had fun skateboarding out on the driveway and playing with the neighbourhood kids. Strawberries and yoghurt for dessert while watching "The War on Waste". Worked more once the kids were in bed, then cleaned up the kitchen, and crashed on the sofa with Dzung before bed.

Now, what was this about HackTile?

Beautiful morning. Eliza off to tennis with Lilian, and Dzung took Jack into North Shore. I slept in, then had boiled eggs for breakfast out in the sunshine while reading The Guardian. Off to Kiet and Van's for roast pork for brunch. I read about the Danish way of life in "The Little Book of Hygge". Thinking about getting some lamps and a gas fire for the lounge room, and of a courtyard makeover.

Went for a walk / bike ride in the afternoon. Eliza unhappy about going to school tomorrow due to the issues she's having with her friends, so we walked and talked while Dzung and Jack rode ahead. Ate Bravo apples and explored Bullcreek; I took them by a different route to the river. Back home for tea and Tim Tams; I did my best to maximise the hygge of the situation! Played Captain Toad with Eliza and then with Jack. Kids practised piano and had showers while I made stir fried vegetables with leftovers, which I served with rice and the hasselback potatoes from the other night. Ended the evening watching two episodes from the new season of Better Call Saul with Dzung.
