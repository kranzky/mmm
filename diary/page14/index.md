Home with the chores while Dzung took the kids to karate and then piano. Leisurely breakfast, reading The Guardian and New Scientist, and podcasting while doing the laundry and cleaning the house. Dropped the kids to Kiet and Van's in the afternoon, then to dinner at Andly's Private Kitchen, near Agworld in West Leederville. It was much better than I expected; every course was delicious, and the lobster in a beer-based stew was a definite highlight!

Picked up the kids on the way back home; they were late to bed. Dzung crashed out, so I watched a couple of episodes of The West Wing before calling it a night.

Jack's "One Big Voice". Very exited; packed him a bag with ham and cheese sandwich, banana, pringles, oreos and cheese and crackers. Eliza did fine at school today. I did three reps of the workout and worked focused all day. Mum and dad over, then to Simple Italian before the show. Caught up with Sonny in the audience. Show was good but hard to see the kids. Jack tired and cranky afterwards... it was a long day for him!

Busy day at work. Took the phones in to get batteries replaced. Eliza very upset after school, having problems with her friends, cried in the bathroom for half of her science class, asked Dzung not to pick up her friends as she usually would. Terrible to see her so upset, and hard to know how to deal with it, apart from listening and cuddling.

Regular day at work. Dzung out in the evening so the kids and I got F&C for dinner, after taking Jack swimming. Ended the night watching Akira. Ages since I've seen it. So bleak! Amazed to see that the plot circles around the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo! Prescient!

Took Eliza in to school early for her athletics carnival, then dropped Jack in. Slow but productive day at work. Did three reps of the workout. West Wing at lunch. Picked up Jack and got annoyed with him always answering back and not doing his homework and piano after school. So frustrated I slammed the door to the office, which gave him a fright. It all ended in tears. I apologised and let him know I don't have to work after getting him from school, and that I can sit with him and help. This eventually cheered him up. Finished homework and played piano together, then did some tidying and started making dinner (afyer picking up Eliza). Kids had baths, Eliza finished off dinner and we ate, then watched a few YouTube videos and played Kirby Star Allies. Kids to bed, then Dzung home from her night out with the girls to celebrate her birthday.

Dzung's birthday! Up early to give cards and take Eliza and then Jack to school. Worked for a bit then lunch at Must. Chacuterie board with duck rilette, pork hock, pate and so on, roast chicken, angelhair crab pasta, wine and cheese. Mooched around Mt. Lawley, bought flowers, then bought a new set of headphones. Picked up Jack and Eliza, then teppanyaki at Nishi. Eliza loved it, Jack was initially scared, but came around by the end. Fantastic food and lots of fun. Feeling very tired, will call it an early night after cleaning up kitchen.

Picked up the kids from their sleepover. Dim sum for lunch, then mooched around Northbridge in the sunny weather and let the kids have a few games at Timezone. Walked to Deep Water Point in the afternoon and had tea and scones at the new Dome Cafe there. Cooked Japanese eggplant for Dzung, and watched The Shape of Water once the kids were asleep.
