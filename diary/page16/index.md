Dzung has to work so I took the kids to karate, and stopped by Garbo on the way home to grab some pies for lunch. Crystal dropped Eli over and I took the kids into the Earth Sciences Museum at UWA where they had a great time looking at minerals and chatting to the lady there to help identify the rocks they've been digging up in the school playground.

Back home via mum and dad's for an afternoon tea of banana bread and crackers. Made Malaysian curry with potatoes, carrots and pork for dinner, along with grilled eggplant and roti. Curry too spicy for the kids, but delicious with a beer. Kids to bed and I cleaned up, then watched "The Death of Stalin" with Dzung.

Casual day. Rainy morning. Did some shopping while kids at school. Good progress at work. Made lamb cutlets and pasta for dinner (mum and dad didn't get the kids due to poor weather). Glass of wine with Dzung to break the drought of dry July. Watched "The War on Waste" with Eliza after dinner. Quiet night, very tired.

Blindsided. Spent yesterday scoping out urgent work that needed to be finished for the customer by Sunday, ready to work on it today and tomorrow. But had another very long meeting today to cancel that, and return to previous work, which I'd put on hold, to modify requirements that were written months ago, which requires existing implementation to be changed. And this piece of work is now super-urgent. This wiped me out; the lack of sleep overnight didn't help. Spent the day in a daze, thinking about life and career and the things I want to be working on. Just fixed bugs and did some work that was blocking a few things, but otherwise dropped out mentally.

Lack of sleep because it was super windy overnight. Hail at 2am. Worried about the bins on the kerbside. Kept getting out of bed to check on them. At 6am I went outside in the dark to find the lid of one of the bins was open, and the bag that was on top had disappeared! It was full of foam that had been used to pack the desk that Dzung bought a while ago, which I'm gradually disposing of, so it would have been very light. Walked up and down the street but couldn't see it anywhere. Terrible way to start the day.

Spent the evening in a depressed funk. Watched the last of Handmaid's Tale, which didn't help. Need to start on a skunkworks project to show my boss how we could be doing things differently, and need to get back to HackTile!

Busy day at work. Early morning meeting, and heads down all morning. Dzung and I to Kitchen Inn for lunch (after trying somewhere else that ended up being closed only on Wednesdays). They got my order wrong, so I only ate half of the plate. Working all afternoon, then cooked dinner with Eliza; steak, cous-cous, baby carrots. Turned out quite nicely.

Kids to bed, finished "Magician's Gambit". Then watched a couple of episodes of "The Handmaid's Tale" before sleep. Stormy outside, worried about the bins. Jack had earlier spotted a crow making a mess of our neighbour's bin, which we tidied up, but it's the wind that worries me.

Busy day at work. Picked up Jack in the middle of the day to visit the immunologist. Needed to talk about Eliza, but they won't give you a follow-up appointment unless you bring a kid along. Found him digging in the playground with Eli and Josh. Appointment was good, happy to have a realistic action plan for anaphylaxis, and not a knee-jerk of giving the epi-pen the moment Eliza mentions a lump in her throat.

Picked up Jack after school and went shopping, then collected Eliza after orchestra. Made mapu tofu for dinner, and second attempt at Japanese-style grilled eggplant. Burned it this time. Hoping for third time lucky tomorrow.

Kids to bed, and I watched a couple of episodes of Handmaid's Tale before retiring. No HackTile.

Walked Jack to school early for school banking. He showed me a map that he had drawn with Eli and Josh for their Geology Club. It was a quite detailed map of the school playground with measurements and everything, along with a description of the digging conditions in the sand pit. Funny!

Returned the stools, then a work meeting and semi-busy day. Mark talking about the new directory product again; got the creative juices flowing. Did three repeats of the seven-minute workout. Watched Handmaid's Tale at lunch. Walked Jack home from school, then to the shops to stock up on some Japanese items. Bought small eggplants to have another attempt at grilled eggplant for tomorrow night. After shopping we picked up Eliza from quiz club.

Home to help Eliza cook the oven backed panko-and-parmesan crusted fish and potato wedges. Turned out great, and enough food for us all to have seconds, and save enough for lunch for all of us tomorrow. Value! Put the kids to bed, then watched an episode of The West Wing. Nada HackTile.

Up early to help Jack finish his North Shore homework, which we neglected yesterday. Then Dzung took him in, and Eliza went to tennis. I did some housework, then breakfasted while reading, and took delivery of the "You Plate It" box for the coming week. Then some gardening out the back. Off to Van and Kiet's for lunch of vietnamese pancakes. Would have been perfect with a beer, but still doing dry July.

Home in the afternoon to help Eliza clean up her room. Then read some more in the sunshine before playing a bit of Elite Dangerous, as the VR was still set up. Made dinner for the kids (leftovers of potato and leek soup, shepherd's pie and steamed brocolli with vinegar rice) before playing a round of "Takenoko" before bed. Read to Eliza, then watched "The Lobster" with Dzung.
