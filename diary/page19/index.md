Regular Saturday. Lazy breakfast, clothes washing and karate. Rushed home via Garbo to pick up groceries for lunch, then kids off to piano while I cleaned my office and tried "MoonQuest". Shopping in the afternoon with Dzung, buying things for dinner and tomorrow's hotpot. Have decided to pause Dry July to be able to drink with our guests. But one day a month is pretty good, right?

Spaghetti and meatballs for dinner, then an episode of BiTfD before playing a few levels of Kirby with the kids. Got some more HackTile done, too.

Now that serialisation is working, I updated the entity editor to allow individual animation frames to be selected. Next will be to draw then animating, and to make it easy to preview animations by moving the controller. Drew some nicer sprites to aid in this work. And, after that, rules!

Took the kids to Riley's for breakfast, then to Garbo where I bought "Captain Toad's Treasure Tracker" and the Ultra HD version of "Bladerunner 2049". Back home late morning and was busy at work for the rest of the day. Kids played games until Eva and Finlay were picked up after lunch.

Squeezed in some HackTile in the late afternoon. Optimised palette swaps, implemented serialisation for sprites, and removed all the code for creating default sprites. Worked great, but will have to revisit at some point when I support an architecture with a different endianess. So animation is now on the agenda. Looking forward to it!

Mum and Dad over to watch "Battle of the Sexes" on the new TV. Had some Thai delivered for dinner. Mum made dessert. Put the kids to bed, and ending the night watching an episode of "Endeavour" with Dzung and a cuppa. Noice.

Dzung took the kids to Scitech to spend some time with their cousins. I worked scoping out the new payments feature for my day job. Enough work to keep me busy for the next fortnight, working towards an end-of-the-month deadline.

Eva and Finlay arrived for a sleepover in the late afternoon. Made lamb cutlets, pasta and salad. Civilised dinner around the dining table while telling jokes, then watched "Early Man" with popcorn. I cleaned up and made the beds while the girls played Letter Tycoon. Eva will be sleeping in my office, so I'm working upstairs for a change. Boys asleep.

Have been thinking about life in general. Want to improve my level of fitness, lose some weight, contribute more to society (I scheduled myself to donate blood again, triggered by Callan's platelets scare), build stuff of value (an old trope of mine, but relevant now that I'm almost finished reading the excellent "Bullshit Jobs" book... working for a salary should only be the journeyman stage between apprentice and master), improve my diet (will restrict myself to three drinks per week once dry July is up) and so on. Lots of life stuff swirling around in my mind today.

HackTile-wise, I've decided to focus on serialisation and forget about generating default sprites, which is just a timewaste. Once serialisation is working I'll be able to load sprites, so the default set could be designed by hand. Will do some work on that tonight, but it will take a bit of time to finish. Once it's done animation will be unblocked. Happy days.

Beautiful day. Took kids to the carwash for breakfast. Getting the car properly cleaned is always cathartic. Tidied up the garden too, and got the kids to finish tidying the house after all the housework I did yesterday. Finished a few big tasks at work, and had a long chat with Will that turned out well. Need to spend the rest of my week on design work, to scope out tasks for the next two weeks, but that seems doable. Will take the kids swimming, and then make lasagna and salad for dinner. And, I promise, will do some HackTile too.

![Map Editor](/diary/assets/map_editor.png)

And so I did! Happy to break the hoodoo. Just some simple work on the map editor; fixing a bug with entity zero not working because of some assumptions made in the rules of Conway's life, and implemented a preview when drawing entities in the map, to be consistent with how sprite drawing works.

Great to be back on the bandwagon. Need to focus now on getting sprite animations working correctly, and then it will be on to serialisation followed by the rules editor. To put meat on the bones, so to speak.

Sigh. Didn't write a diary entry yesterday. And instead of going to bed at a reasonable time, I surfed Reddit for a couple of hours. Wrong, wrong, wrong. It's hard to get back into the swing of things after taking a break, but I must do it. Watched a talk by Jonathon Blow on YouTube about getting over a lack of enthusiasm, but it didn't help.

Kids were away too; Eliza went swimming with a friend, and Jack went to the movies with Mum and Finlay. Dzung's desk was delivered, so I spent a good part of the day setting that up instead, which was physically exhausting. And I cleaned the house a bit. Then there were some urgent tasks with my day job, and a looming deadling at the end of the month that I'll need to work extra hours to hit.

Made steaks and mashed potato with green beans for dinner. Delicious. Usual bedtime routine. Eliza very tired after her big day.

Took the kids to Garden City in the morning to get some hotdog buns, then back home to work. Eliza had some friends over for the day; Cindy and Zophia and Cindy's little sister. They baked cakes and ate hotdogs for lunch. They had a great time together, and were inclusive of Jack. No fighting or breaking anything; they were all well behaved and cleaned up after themselves. Proud of them all! I managed to work a full, busy day.

Picked up Dzung from the station and drove to visit Daz to celebrate his 44th. Sat outside by the fire. Jack had a ball playing table tennis, and Eliza sat happily with Archie on the sofa near the fire. Chicken and pizza and sausage rolls for dinner, then chocolate cake and tea. Caught up with Cam's dad, and Dad told us about a game he played with his grandfather as a kid, where you throw a ring tied to a string towards a hook in the wall. Searched for it on the phone; turns out it's an old pub game called "ring the bull" or something. Will try to set it up for Christmas.

Home late and put the kids to bed. Tired, and no desire to start work on HackTile. I did spend a bit of time today going through what I plan to do next, and running it to test a few things, so there's that at least.

Slept in, then a breakfast of scrambled eggs with leftover toasted baguatte outside in the winter sunshine. Picked up the kids; they didn't want to leave as they'd made new friends and were playing out the front. To Van's for spaghetti vongole. Returned home for a rest; I had a bad sinus headache that risked developing into a migraine, so lights out and listening to The West Wing Weekly with a strong coffee. A light dinner of leftover Cahn Chua, then watched an episode of Back in Time for Dinner. Must get back on to the HackTile bandwagon!
