Long time! So what's happened in the last six months?

- I'm slowly looking for work. Not good medicine for the ego.
- Got MegaHAL back online again at [megahal.kranzky.com](https://megahal.kranzky.com)
- Working on Lazybones (formerly Hacktile) and it's going well
- Released Sesame with Jack

I also released Gravitas at the end of last year. So feeling pretty productive, even though I'm not earning a lot of $ at the moment.

Keeping fit and doing heaps of reading; 24 books so far this year. Have just joined a few different libraries as it's getting to be an expensive hobby.

New bike has been ordered and will be delivered in September. Looking forward to it. Managed to dodge COVID; both the kids had it recently but they isolated in their bedrooms and we kept the windows open even though it was freezing cold.

I'll try to write more regularly again as I enjoy reading mundane daily entries from a few years ago. It's the usual thing; I feel I've got nothing to write, and I always hate what I've written until enough time passes. Then it seems OK.

Plan is to release Lazybones soon, build some landing pages to try to get a new startup idea off the ground, start earning money again in a new job, and generally avoid COVID and have fun with the family. A simple life.

Last post before I turn `0x32` on Saturday.

Had a great 2021, releasing 5 projects. Finished and launched "Gravitas" on Christmas Eve.

This year I'm having a bit of a break in January, spending time with the kids and so forth, but in the background Beetlefeet and I have been working on coming up with 100 startup ideas. I did the "Aspiring Founders" startup school as part of this effort.

I also wrote a Twitter bot to solve the daily Wordle.

I plan to divide by week between 6 activities this year:

- GroupFire
- The Punk Collective
- Untitled Startup
- Fun Hacks
- Exercise
- Reading

We'll see how it goes!

BLaTTiX is released! After two weeks of crunch, the game finally came together. Fifteen levels spread across five planets, with eight enemy types. Not too shabby! Reckon I spent around 350 hours on this, spread across 129 calendar days. And now I'm learning to market something I've made. Sales are trickling in, and I'm planning to write and post about the project in the hope of capturing an audience. But, soon, it will be on to something else.

Well, here we are in mid-July; kids about to return to school after two weeks off. We spent some time down in Bunbury, which was nice.

I can see the finish line for Blattix; I have a small list of work to complete over the next ten days, and expect to entirely wrap it up by the end of the month. I also released a [starter kit](https://github.com/kranzky/raylib-flecs-starter-kit) for using Raylib+Flecs, and I plan to use this as the framework for my Deminer and Noid experiments.

Been somewhat distracted by the NSW lockdown, but deliberately weaning myself off the doomscrolling and the live press conferences. Must focus on productivity.

Will dust off Punk / Gumshoe / Hacktile later this week. Also plan to do some MegaHAL work so I can get a monkey off my back; a MegaHAL fan has asked that the new implementation be able to load brainfiles generated by the old 1990s version, and I reckon I can bust that out too.

Wish me luck!

Well, we're in lockdown yet again and BLaTTiX is getting close to beta release. As we go into July I expect the following will happen:

- I'll work less on BLaTTiX, switching more to a mode of responding to bug reports and generally polishing it up for release (probably on September 1).
- Prototyping work will start on a couple of smaller-scope projects, "Noid" and "Deminer".
- Gumshoe, HackTile and Punk! will be dusted off, and basically upgraded to use the latest versions of libraries &c.
- I may start exploring DownTown, Sesame and Onesie, my other 2021 projects.

All in all that's a lot! Together with RnDB, which has already been completed, that makes 10 projects for the year. And we're only just halfway through. Wow!

Long time! You should probably note that all BLaTTiX talk has moved over to the [Itch Page](https://thepunkcollective.itch.io/blattix). With only a month of development left, the game is really coming together. Looking forward to starting a new project soon!

The lockdown gamejam went swimmingly; I finished all of the gameplay work that I intended to do, and I shipped the game to alpha testers on [Itch](https://kranzky.itch.io/blattix), adding both Windows and Mac builds. Feedback has been positive so far.

More recently, I've refactored the code to integrate [Flecs](https://github.com/SanderMertens/flecs), an entity-component system, which has helped to clean up the codebase enormously, and which will make it easier to build more complicated game systems.

I also lost a day to Linux in an attempt to get a build out; I've installed Debian 7 on two VMs (32-bit and 64-bit) and have a binary built, but the VMs won't run the game due to a lack of support for the GL calls I'm making, so I'll need to test that by installing a more modern Linux on my PC. But with installing Linux, programming in vanilla C and re-watching [Serial Experiments Lain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp5kUmni5Dk), it's like I've been transported back to the year 2000.

Speaking of, I've been learning a bit about "Modern C", and the differences between C11, C99 and ANSI C, which is what I learned back in the nineties. Most notable are three features that I've come to rely on:

- Variable-length arrays.
- Designated initializers.
- Compound literals.

I'll also make sure to use `inline` functions where it makes sense to do so. And the other C99 features, such as single-line comments and a proper boolean type, are hardly worth mentioning.

Another change to how I used to write C is a preference for pass-by-value and return-by-value instead of by reference. Which means fewer pointers and less manual memory allocation. These days it can be faster to use immediate values than references for small structures, and compilers will copy the data into registers. Nice!
