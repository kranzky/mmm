# Executive Summary

The MMM [project](/) merges the techniques of information retrieval and hypertext to make an easy but powerful global information system.

Inspired by the [World Wide Web](https://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html), the Massive Markdown Matrix is a system of interlinked [Markdown](markdown.md) documents that are accessed via the Internet. It has the following characteristics:

* It is read-only, with only GET requests being supported.
* Information is retrieved and rendered using Markdown instead of HTML.
* There is no support for JavaScript or CSS.

This means two things:

1. Browsers can be lightweight and efficient.
2. It's mostly useful for static data.
