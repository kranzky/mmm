# Get Involved

There are lots of ways you can help if you are interested in seeing the matrix grow and be even more useful...

#### [Put up some data](technical-details.md)
There are many ways of doing this. The matrix needs both raw data -- fresh hypertext or old plain text files, or smart servers giving views of existing databases.

#### Suggest someone else does
Maybe you know a system which it would be neat to have on the matrix. How about suggesting to the person involved that they put up a M3 server?

#### Manage a subject area
If you know something of what's going on in a particular field, organization or country, would you like to keep up-to-date an overview of online data?

#### [Write some software](getting-code.md)
