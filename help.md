## Vertext Browser

The [Vertext](vertext.md) browser is available at [vertext.kranzky.com](https://vertext.kranzky.com) and is currently a web-only pre-alpha preview. It will be available as a native app for Mac, Windows, iOS and Android in the future.

The browser currently has no keyboard controls. Links always open in a new tab. The markdown implementation is a bit rough around the edges, but it is usable. The browser is designed to be fast and simple, with a focus on Markdown documents.

Please report bugs and feature requests [here](https://github.com/kranzky/vertext/issues).
