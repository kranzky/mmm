# What is HyperText?

Hypertext is text which is not constrained to be linear.

Hypertext is text which contains links to other texts. The term was coined by [Ted Nelson](xanadu.md) around 1965 (see [History](hypertext-history.md)).

HyperMedia is a term used for hypertext which is not constrained to be text: it can include graphics, video and sound, for example. Apparently Ted Nelson was the first to use this term too.

Hypertext and HyperMedia are concepts, not products.
