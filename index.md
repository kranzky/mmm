# MASSIVE MARKDOWN MATRIX

The MassiveMarkdownMatrix (M3) is wide-area information retrieval initiative
inspired by the WorldWideWeb (W3) with the following features:

* It is read-only, with only GET requests being supported.
* Information is retrieved and rendered using Markdown instead of HTML.
* There is no support for JavaScript or CSS.

This means two things:

1. Browsers can be lightweight and efficient.
1. It's mostly useful for static data.

There is [another page here](another.md).

There is a [directory here](directory).
