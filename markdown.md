# Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight markup language created by John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. It is designed to be easy to read and write, while also being convertible to HTML for web publishing.

## Features of Markdown

- **Simple Syntax**: Markdown uses plain text formatting, making it accessible to everyone.
- **Portable**: Markdown files are plain text, so they can be opened and edited on any platform.
- **Extensible**: Many tools and libraries extend Markdown with additional features, such as tables, footnotes, and syntax highlighting.

## Common Markdown Elements

- **Headings**: Use `#` for headings, e.g., `# Heading 1`, `## Heading 2`.
- **Lists**: Create ordered lists with numbers and unordered lists with `-` or `*`.
- **Links**: `[Link Text](URL)` creates a hyperlink.
- **Images**: `![Alt Text](Image URL)` embeds an image.
- **Code**: Use backticks \` for inline code or triple backticks for code blocks.

## Example
