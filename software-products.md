At the time of writing, there are two options for browsing the Massive Markdown Matrix.

## Vertext

You can use the [Vertext](vertext.md) MMM browser by visiting [vertext.kranzky.com](https://vertext.kranzky.com). This is a lightweight browser that is in active development, and which does not use a HTML view to render Markdown content. It will soon be released as a standalone application for mobile and desktop platforms.

## Markdown Browser Extension

If you install a Markdown browser extension, you can view the MMM in your WWW browser. For example, if you use Chrome you could install the [Markdown Viewer](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/markdown-viewer/ckkdlimhmcjmikdlpkmbgfkaikojcbjk) extension.
