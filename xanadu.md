# Ted Nelson and Xanadu

Ted Nelson originally coined the term **"hypertext"** to describe "non-sequential writing." His enduring fascination with hypertext led to the creation of the **Xanadu project**. Currently owned by Autodesk, the Xanadu Operating Company continues to develop the project.

Nelson elaborates on his philosophy, his colleagues, and the Xanadu project in his book *Literary Machines*. This self-published work (e.g., *LM 90.1*) is essential reading for understanding the background, enthusiasm, and ideas surrounding hypertext. It also includes the text of Vannevar Bush's 1945 article *"As We May Think"*, which proposed the concept of an automated **MEMEX** (memory extension) to augment human memory through mechanical means.

The Xanadu project introduces several innovative concepts, such as:

- Generating unique names for new documents to ensure they can always be located.
- Attributing royalties to authors whenever their work is retrieved across the network.

Ted Nelson also publishes a video where he explains his ideas in detail. For more information, you can contact:
